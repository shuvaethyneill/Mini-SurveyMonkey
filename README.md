# Mini-SurveyMonkey
[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/andre-Hazim/Mini-SurveyMonkeySYSC4806/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andre-Hazim/Mini-SurveyMonkeySYSC4806/actions/workflows/maven.yml)

# Description
This project aims to implement a survey creation tool, empowering users to create and conduct surveys effortlessly. Leveraging NoSQL technology (MongoDB), Spring, and Java, this application offers a dynamic platform for surveyors to create surveys with different question types, including text, numeric range, and multiple-choice questions. Leveraging NoSQL specifically removes the need for having a predefined schema, allowing us to store forms where the structure of questions and responses vary from survey to survey along with adapting to changing survery requirements without altering the database structure.

# Current Progress
We have now completed the Final Demo. Our project was completed on schedule and was tracked using our Jira Board: https://minisurveymonkey.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MS/boards/1

This project leverages MongoDB to perform the noSQL operations in our MiniSruvey Project. The web application is functional and has the following features implemented:
- **Create Form**
  - Form questions can be multiple choice, take a number input, or be a text input
    - Multiple choice fields can be individually added or removed (default of 2)
    - Number fields can have a lower or upper bound set
  - Takes in form title as input
  - Form questions can be individually deleted
  - Has the ability to submit the form or reset the form entirely
- **View Single Form and Respond**
  - Display all the questions back to the user
    - Shows form name
    - Correctly displays multiple choice, number field, and text field
    - User can fill out form with responses and submit (Alpha-Release)
    - Upon submitting a form, users are brought to a success page and can navigate to the View All Forms page (Alpha-Release)
- **View All Forms View**
  - Displays all forms in a list (clickable)
  - User can also search for a form based on id
- **User profile**
  - Users can login with a username to keep track of who is an author or not when responding to forms
- **Close Form**
  - Author can close their form. Doing so will display form responses (analytics for each question)
    - Pie chart for multiple choice question
    - Graph for numerical field question
    - Scrollable list for text responses
-  **Delete Form** (Final Demo addition)
  - Author can delete a form they have previously created (closed or not). 
    - Delete form button appears only for the author of the form
- **Edit Form** (Final Demo addition)
